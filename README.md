# Technical Engagement DNS Lab

Welcome to the DNS lab of ICANNs Technical Engagement Team!

To participate in this lab you will need to bring 
your own laptop, some - but not much - DNS knowledge
and a good mood.
> [!TIP] 
> Experience with the linux command line is a plus.  

The lab consists of a number of presentations that will explain
parts of the DNS ecosystem and a number of practical hands-on labs.
