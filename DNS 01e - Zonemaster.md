From zonemaster.net:
> Give your domain name a complete checkup! Zonemaster helps you assess 
> how your domain name is doing. When a domain name is sent to Zonemaster 
> for testing, Zonemaster investigates the state of the domain name from 
> the top to the bottom of the DNS tree. [...]
>
> Zonemaster performs many tests, such as checking DNSSEC signatures, or 
> that different hosts can be accessed and that IP addresses are valid. 
> This is all to make sure that your domain name runs as smoothly as possible.
