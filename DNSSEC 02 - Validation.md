# DNSSEC Validation

The easiest way to start with DNSSEC is validation. Everybody uses a resolver
and enabling the resolver to do DNSSEC validation is the easiest way to protect
DNS traffic from spoofing.  
And when you DNSSEC sign your own domain names it is
good practice to also run a validating resolver. I helps you to become aware of problems much faster.
